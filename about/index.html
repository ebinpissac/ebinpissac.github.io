		<div class="about">
			<h1>In a nutshell</h1>
			<p>I was born in a place called Kakkoor in the Ernakulam district of Kerala in India. I did my schooling in some nearby schools till I was 17. In 2011, I came to Singapore for my higher studies. I did my Diploma in Micro and Nanotechnology from Republic Polytechnic, and started working in Globalfoundries. Since my interest was to be in the IT industry, I started taking my part time degree in Computer Science from The University of Adelaide. Hopefully I will be able to complete by June 2017. I am currenly working as Systems Technologist at Micron Technology </p>
