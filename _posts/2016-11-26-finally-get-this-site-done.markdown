<p>Well I think I am finally done with my website. It took me a long time to decide on what platform, then on what theme, on what domain and so on. Gotta stick with jekyll and github pages for now, with this&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ebinissac.online">ebinissac.online</a> domain. My initial plan was to build the page using Wordpress, which is probably the most popular platform. Even though I am a technical guy, I really could not figure out on how to use it properly, and fed up really fast. What more, ditched it. Then I came across Weebly, which is really nice, and easy and beautiful. I even built a site in a way that I intended. Unfortunately, it was too expensive for me pay them for a site that I am not even sure whether I use it or not. I found more site builders like wix, google sites, ucoz etc etc. They were either expensive, or ugly, or slow. It was then I came to know about github pages. Since its just static, the page loading was quick, and it was FREE! What more, I decided to use it. The next confusion was to select the theme. After hours of research and tests, I choose <a href="https://github.com/hemangsk/DevJournal">DevJournal</a>. Thanks to the developer. </p>
