<p>Its the new year. 2015 was really a bad year for me. I was hospitalised twice, had to undergo surgery, made some bad decisions, ahh..it was terrible.</p>
<p>But 2016 was probably the best year I had in years. The year started with a job in Micron, which is not really a bad job. At least I dont mind going there unlike my previous jobs. I learned quite few things, and its where I realised that my field is System Administration, not programming.</p>
<p>When the year started, I had some targets to do, such as :</p>
<ul>
<li>Start hitting the gym</li>
<li>Gain some weight</li>
<li>Complete System Admin course and get the certification</li>
<li>Build this website</li>
</ul>
<p>Really happy to say that I managed to do all these. Since started hitting the gym, I gained almost 9 kg of weight. I reached 60kg from 51kg in 9 months, which is remarkable considering the fact that I barely increased any weight since I came to Singapore. I also completed the Red Hat system adminstration course, and got the certificate, <a href="https://www.redhat.com/rhtapps/certification/verify/?certId=160-274-445&amp;isSearch=False&amp;verify=Verify">RHCE and RHCSA</a>. Although I couldn't take LFCS exam in 2016, I will take it in first week of 2017. Finally, building this website was one of my long time dreams, and finally it became true. I am not sure how often I update this, but nevertheless, a website is a website.</p>
<p>For 2017, I have some targets. These are a bit more tougher than what I had in 2016, but if I can manage to get them done, that is going to be great.[Hiding them for now]</p>
<ul>
<li>------------</li>
<li>------------</li>
<li>------------</li>
<li>------------</li>
<li>------------</li>
</ul>
<p>Let us see how it goes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Happy new year everyone :)</p>
